# Multi-Vendor Order Management System - Backend - Node.js with Express and MongoDB

This project is a RESTful API for managing a collection of books. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (accessed via Mongoose). It also incorporates features like input validation, error handling, logging, and authentication.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Node.js + Express.js**
- **MongoDB + Mongoose**
- **Zod** for request validation
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Bcrypt** for password hashing
- **MongoDB Transactions** for order placement
- Modular, clean folder structure

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:**  Version 18 or higher is recommended.  Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm:**  Node Package Manager (usually comes with Node.js)
*   **MongoDB:**  Make sure you have a MongoDB server running, either locally or in the cloud.  Download from [https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## 2. Installation

1.  **Download the repository:**

    ```bash
    cd book-api
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## 3. Configuration

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**

    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.  This file will store your environment variables.  Do *not* commit this file to version control.

2.  **Set environment variables:**

    Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file, replacing the example values with your actual configuration:

    ```
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/vendormanagement  # Replace with your MongoDB URI
    JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key                 # Replace with a strong, random secret key
    ```

    See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for more details.

## 4. Running the Application

There are two ways to run the application:

*   **Development Mode (with automatic restarts):**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This uses `nodemon` to monitor the project files for changes and automatically restart the server.  This is ideal for development.

*   **Production Mode:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This runs the application using Node.js directly.  This is suitable for production deployments.

    The server will start and listen on the port specified in your `.env` file (or port 3000 if the `PORT` variable is not set).
